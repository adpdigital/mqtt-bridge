# mqtt-bridge

This fully configurable MQTT bridge subscribes to MQTT broker for defined topic and streams messages published to that topic to dynamically defined backends. The configured backends subscribe to simple `data` and `flush` events which give them access to the message `topic` and `content` whenever new messages for the defined topic arrive. 

Supported backends:

* Console (default)
* Redis
* statsd
* RethinkDB
* TempoDB (alpha)
* Graphite 
* AWS Kinesis 
* Graphite
* Xively 

> New backends will be added, if you don't see what you need, contribute. 

## Configuration

The app includes a sample configuration file: `config-sample.json`. Simply rename that file to `config.json` and edit the portent elements:
    
### MQTT

If your broker does not require secure client, simply switch the `secure` and remove the no longer needed elements from the `args`: `keyPath`, `certPath`. If no authentication is required you can further remove the `username` and `password` arguments. For each one of these use-cases, the MQTT broker will also need require a different port.

	"mqtt": {
		"secure": true,
		"topic": "#",
		"host": "mqtt.mydomain.com",
		"port": 8884,
		"args": {
			"clientId": "mqtt-bridge",
			"keyPath": "./certs/client.key",
			"certPath": "./certs/client.crt",
			"username": "sampleuser",
			"password": "samplepassword",
			"keepalive": 59000
		}
	}

> The small `keepalive` is to workaround for AWS ELB timeouts. Feel free to increase that number if you are not load-balancing the MQTT broker.

### Backends

For each backend, you must define two arguments: `handler` with the implementation file (probably located in the backends directory) and the `config` arguments for that backend. These will be anything the backend requires.

    "backends": [
    
    	{
			"handler": "./backends/some-backend.js",
			"config": {
				"arg": "val"
			}
    	}
    
    ]
    
> Remember, some backends require additional installation before the initial run.

### Logging

To change the verbosity of console logging, you can alter the `level` argument. See `winston` documentation for `mqtt-bridge` supported levels (debug, info, warn, error).

    "log": {
		"level": "debug",
		"timestamp": true
    }


## Installation

    $ npm install mqtt-bridge
    
## Standalone Usage

To run the `mqtt-bridge` as a standalone app, simply use the provided `start-bridge.sh` scripts which will provision `forever` to assure continuous uptime. 

    $ ./start-bridge.sh
    
To stop the service either the `stop` command in `forever` or simply execute the provided script

    $ ./stop-bridge.sh
